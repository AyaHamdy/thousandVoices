# Intro
This contains the code to package ([MLFlow](http://mlflow.org/)) and deploy ([flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/)) a pre-trained TTS model.

The pre-trained model was provided [Tomoki Hayashi](https://github.com/kan-bayashi) as part of the [espnet](https://github.com/espnet) project.
This includes a Tacotron2 model and a parallelWaveGan.

The x-vectors (speaker embeddings) have been extracted from the [libritts](http://www.openslr.org/resources/60) dataset. 

The artifacts are available [here](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AsC_YGX9uGhggZYnsjGU3Swtcb4ATA?e=UF4dcF).
